When scrawl build is run independently (so not the first time, perhaps it would make sense to not build the first time), I want to send an email to myself in whcih I attach the PDF and put any relevant information in the subject heading and body of the email. Perhaps we even copy the full text into the body of the email. That would be pretty rad.
