- clean up all the code / standardize things like var declarations, param names
- add a list feature, that will filter the display
- make sure everything is done responsibly -- make a list of things you shoud refactor
	and what each refactoring would entail
- remove build pdf step from open file and close
- Better formatted messaging ("begin saving index" ?)
- Ensure word count of arguments -- this will probably be important in the list section
- Consider a way of creating a test library
